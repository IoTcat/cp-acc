## project instruction

This project is suitable for the automatic allocation of public expenditure bills in scenarios such as shared leases or partnership travel. This way you don’t have to work part-time as an accountant every time you hang out with your friends (￣ω￣(￣ω￣〃 (￣ω￣〃)ゝ)


## Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to automate the process of public expenditure bill settlement, with the goal of providing convenience to users. After the bill is created, you can submit it directly from the bill when you encounter public consumption. At the end of the dissolution, the system will tell you who should give to whom (as much as possible).

## The main function

 - Users can register and log in (through the Ushio user system)
 - Users can create public bills
 - Users can join the public bill at any time
 - Users can bind multiple public bills at the same time
 - Users can settle and log out public bills at any time
 - Users can submit expenditures to public bills and upload invoices (evidence)
 - Show users recent consumption status, reports, forecasts, etc.
 - Users can retrospectively check the details of any past expenditure
 - The system will promptly remind friends to give and receive money (internal circulation) according to the threshold set when creating the bill
 - The small partner designated by the system to receive the money needs to confirm the circulation from the email or website before it will be credited to the account.
